## Setup/Installation Requirements
  - ### If you have difficulty following any of the steps/instructions listed below, please contact me at josephnero111@gmail.com 

#### Software requirements 

1. A web browser to view the website. I would recommend Google Chrome. 
2. To clone the repository from Github using git commands in the terminal, you need a terminal program & Git. Instructions for installing Git Bash, my recommended terminal program for the Windows OS, are below. Installing Git Bash will also install Git. You can also download [Git Bash here](https://gitforwindows.org/). 
3. To view/edit the code, you need a code editor. Instructions for installing VSCode, my recommended code editor, are listed below. You can also download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

#### To view this website online please use the following GH-Pages link:

            git clone https://github.com/joey3001/first-friday-project.git

6. Navigate into the directory you have just cloned by using the CD command in the Git Bash command line. You should only have to enter the following command : 

            cd first-friday-project 

7. Once you are within the cloned directory, enter the following command in the Git Bash command line to open the project html page in your default browser :
